## "ALLCF3-BPS.csv"
13 samples, 40 spots per sample, 520 rows. Columns represent TGS signals' extracted functional parameters table + an additional column I calculated manually called "binary peak split" by eye balling TGS signals time-domain and frequency-domain to determine whether there is peak splitting "1", no speak splitting "0", or inconclusive "-".
